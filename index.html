      I decided to make a website. For now, we've got a clock, a single text area, one of my favorite fonts,
      and some awesome colors. I'm going to attempt to automate posts soon and send them directly to a specific
      folder on my CDN. That'll give the option to add timestamps automatically and dynamically load content like a blog.
      I'll add some easter eggs as well that you'll be able to see later, though really I don't feel like doing many
      at the moment. It's late. I've got quite a bit planned for this site, though almost all of it will be for my own
      learning experience. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I am extremely gay.</div>
